    Example 1: Trivial Quiver

    >>> from plotly.figure_factory import create_quiver
    >>> import math

    >>> # 1 Arrow from (0,0) to (1,1)
    >>> fig = create_quiver(x=[0], y=[0], u=[1], v=[1], scale=1)
    >>> fig.show()


    Example 2: Quiver plot using meshgrid

    >>> from plotly.figure_factory import create_quiver

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import math

    >>> # Add data
    >>> x,y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(0, 2, .2), np.arange(0, 2, .2))
    >>> u = np.cos(x)*y
    >>> v = np.sin(x)*y

    >>> #Create quiver
    >>> fig = create_quiver(x, y, u, v)
    >>> fig.show()


    Example 3: Styling the quiver plot

    >>> from plotly.figure_factory import create_quiver
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import math

    >>> # Add data
    >>> x, y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(-np.pi, math.pi, .5),
    ...                    np.arange(-math.pi, math.pi, .5))
    >>> u = np.cos(x)*y
    >>> v = np.sin(x)*y

    >>> # Create quiver
    >>> fig = create_quiver(x, y, u, v, scale=.2, arrow_scale=.3, angle=math.pi/6,
    ...                     name='Wind Velocity', line=dict(width=1))

    >>> # Add title to layout
    >>> fig.update_layout(title='Quiver Plot') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> fig.show()


    Example 4: Forcing a fix scale ratio to maintain the arrow length

    >>> from plotly.figure_factory import create_quiver
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> # Add data
    >>> x,y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(0.5, 3.5, .5), np.arange(0.5, 4.5, .5))

    >>> angle = np.arctan(v / u)
    >>> norm = 0.25
    >>> u = norm * np.cos(angle)
    >>> v = norm * np.sin(angle)

    >>> # Create quiver with a fix scale ratio
    >>> fig = create_quiver(x, y, u, v, scale = 1, scaleratio = 0.5)
