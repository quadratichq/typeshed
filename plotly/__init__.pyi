https://plot.ly/python/

Plotly's Python API allows users to programmatically access Plotly's
server resources.

This package is organized as follows:

Subpackages:

- plotly: all functionality that requires access to Plotly's servers

- graph_objs: objects for designing figures and visualizing data

- matplotlylib: tools to convert matplotlib figures

Modules:

- tools: some helpful tools that do not require access to Plotly's servers

- utils: functions that you probably won't need, but that subpackages use

- version: holds the current API version

- exceptions: defines our custom exception classes
