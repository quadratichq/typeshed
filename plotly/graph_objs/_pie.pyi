            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order of this trace's sectors. To be seen,

        hovertextsrc

        ids

            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc

        insidetextfont

        insidetextorientation
            Controls the orientation of the text inside chart
            sectors. When set to "auto", text may be oriented in
            any direction in order to be as big as possible in the
            middle of a sector. The "horizontal" option orients
            text to be parallel with the bottom of the chart, and
            may make text smaller in order to achieve that goal.
            The "radial" option orients text along the radius of
            the sector. The "tangential" option orients text
            perpendicular to the radius of the sector.
        label0
            Alternate to `labels`. Builds a numeric set of labels.
            Use with `dlabel` where `label0` is the starting label
            and `dlabel` the step.
        labels
            Sets the sector labels. If `labels` entries are
            duplicated, we sum associated `values` or simply count
            occurrences if `values` is not provided. For other
            array attributes (including color) we use the first
            non-empty entry among all occurrences of the label.
        labelssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `labels`.

            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",
            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in

        legendgrouptitle

            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank

            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.
        legendwidth

            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc

        pull
            Sets the fraction of larger radius to pull the sectors
            out from the center. This can be a constant to pull all
            slices apart from each other equally or an array to
            highlight one or more slices.
        pullsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `pull`.
        rotation
            Instead of the first slice starting at 12 o'clock,
            rotate to some other angle.
        scalegroup
            If there are multiple pie charts that should be sized
            according to their totals, link them by providing a
            non-empty group id here shared by every trace in the
            same group.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        sort
            Determines whether or not the sectors are reordered
            from largest to smallest.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.pie.Stream` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each sector. If
            trace `textinfo` contains a "text" flag, these elements
            will be seen on the chart. If trace `hoverinfo`
            contains a "text" flag and "hovertext" is not set,
            these elements will be seen in the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the font used for `textinfo`.
        textinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on the graph.
        textposition
            Specifies the location of the `textinfo`.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variables `label`, `color`, `value`, `percent` and
            `text`.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        title
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.pie.Title` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        titlefont
            Deprecated: Please use pie.title.font instead. Sets the
            font used for `title`. Note that the title's font used
            to be set by the now deprecated `titlefont` attribute.
        titleposition
            Deprecated: Please use pie.title.position instead.
            Specifies the location of the `title`. Note that the
            title's position used to be set by the now deprecated
            `titleposition` attribute.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        values
            Sets the values of the sectors. If omitted, we count
            occurrences of each label.
        valuessrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `values`.
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
