        The 'line' property is an instance of Line
        that may be specified as:
          - An instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.layout.newselection.Line`
          - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
            to the Line constructor

            Supported dict properties:

                color
                    Sets the line color. By default uses either
                    dark grey or white to increase contrast with
                    background color.
                dash
                    Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash
                    type string ("solid", "dot", "dash",
                    "longdash", "dashdot", or "longdashdot") or a

                width
                    Sets the line width (in px).
