          - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
            to the Label constructor

            Supported dict properties:

                font
                    Sets the shape label text font.
                padding
                    Sets padding (in px) between edge of label and
                    edge of shape.
                text
                    Sets the text to display with shape. It is also
                    used for legend item if `name` is not provided.
                textangle
                    Sets the angle at which the label text is drawn
                    with respect to the horizontal. For lines,
                    angle "auto" is the same angle as the line. For
                    all other shapes, angle "auto" is horizontal.
                textposition
                    Sets the position of the label text relative to
                    the shape. Supported values for rectangles,
                    circles and paths are *top left*, *top center*,
                    *top right*, *middle left*, *middle center*,
                    *middle right*, *bottom left*, *bottom center*,
                    and *bottom right*. Supported values for lines
                    are "start", "middle", and "end". Default:
                    *middle center* for rectangles, circles, and
                    paths; "middle" for lines.
                texttemplate
                    Template string used for rendering the shape's
                    label. Note that this will override `text`.
                    Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for
                    example "x0: %{x0}". Numbers are formatted
                    using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format},
                    for example "Price: %{x0:$.2f}". See https://gi
                    thub.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for
                    details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
                    formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
                    %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
                    %{x0|%m %b %Y}". See
                    https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                    format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on
                    the date formatting syntax. A single
                    multiplication or division operation may be
                    applied to numeric variables, and combined with
                    d3 number formatting, for example "Length in
                    cm: %{x0*2.54}", "%{slope*60:.1f} meters per
                    second." For log axes, variable values are
                    given in log units. For date axes, x/y
                    coordinate variables and center variables use
                    datetimes, while all other variable values use
                    values in ms. Finally, the template string has
                    access to variables `x0`, `x1`, `y0`, `y1`,
                    `slope`, `dx`, `dy`, `width`, `height`,
                    `length`, `xcenter` and `ycenter`.
                xanchor
                    Sets the label's horizontal position anchor
                    This anchor binds the specified `textposition`
                    to the "left", "center" or "right" of the label
                    text. For example, if `textposition` is set to
                    *top right* and `xanchor` to "right" then the
                    right-most portion of the label text lines up
                    with the right-most edge of the shape.
                yanchor
                    Sets the label's vertical position anchor This
                    anchor binds the specified `textposition` to
                    the "top", "middle" or "bottom" of the label
                    text. For example, if `textposition` is set to
                    *top right* and `yanchor` to "top" then the
                    top-most portion of the label text lines up
                    with the top-most edge of the shape.

        name
            When used in a template, named items are created in the
            output figure in addition to any items the figure
            already has in this array. You can modify these items
            in the output figure by making your own item with
            `templateitemname` matching this `name` alongside your
            modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:
            false` to hide it). Has no effect outside of a
            template.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the shape.
        path
            For `type` "path" - a valid SVG path with the pixel
            values replaced by data values in
            `xsizemode`/`ysizemode` being "scaled" and taken
            unmodified as pixels relative to `xanchor` and
            `yanchor` in case of "pixel" size mode. There are a few
            restrictions / quirks only absolute instructions, not
            relative. So the allowed segments are: M, L, H, V, Q,
            C, T, S, and Z arcs (A) are not allowed because radius
            rx and ry are relative. In the future we could consider
            supporting relative commands, but we would have to
            decide on how to handle date and log axes. Note that
            even as is, Q and C Bezier paths that are smooth on
            linear axes may not be smooth on log, and vice versa.
            no chained "polybezier" commands - specify the segment
            type for each one. On category axes, values are numbers
            scaled to the serial numbers of categories because
            using the categories themselves there would be no way
            to describe fractional positions On data axes: because
            space and T are both normal components of path strings,
            we can't use either to separate date from time parts.
            Therefore we'll use underscore for this purpose:

        showlegend
            Determines whether or not this shape is shown in the

        templateitemname
            Used to refer to a named item in this array in the
            template. Named items from the template will be created
            even without a matching item in the input figure, but
            you can modify one by making an item with
            `templateitemname` matching its `name`, alongside your
            modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:
            false` to hide it). If there is no template or no
            matching item, this item will be hidden unless you
            explicitly show it with `visible: true`.
        type
            Specifies the shape type to be drawn. If "line", a line
            is drawn from (`x0`,`y0`) to (`x1`,`y1`) with respect
            to the axes' sizing mode. If "circle", a circle is
            drawn from ((`x0`+`x1`)/2, (`y0`+`y1`)/2)) with radius
            (|(`x0`+`x1`)/2 - `x0`|, |(`y0`+`y1`)/2 -`y0`)|) with
            respect to the axes' sizing mode. If "rect", a
            rectangle is drawn linking (`x0`,`y0`), (`x1`,`y0`),
            (`x1`,`y1`), (`x0`,`y1`), (`x0`,`y0`) with respect to
            the axes' sizing mode. If "path", draw a custom SVG
            path using `path`. with respect to the axes' sizing
            mode.
        visible
            Determines whether or not this shape is visible. If
            "legendonly", the shape is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x0
            Sets the shape's starting x position. See `type` and
            `xsizemode` for more info.
        x1
            Sets the shape's end x position. See `type` and
            `xsizemode` for more info.
        xanchor
            Only relevant in conjunction with `xsizemode` set to
            "pixel". Specifies the anchor point on the x axis to
            which `x0`, `x1` and x coordinates within `path` are
            relative to. E.g. useful to attach a pixel sized shape
            to a certain data value. No effect when `xsizemode` not
            set to "pixel".
        xref
            Sets the shape's x coordinate axis. If set to a x axis
            id (e.g. "x" or "x2"), the `x` position refers to a x
            coordinate. If set to "paper", the `x` position refers
            to the distance from the left of the plotting area in
            normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the
            left (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by
            "domain" (separated by a space), the position behaves
            like for "paper", but refers to the distance in
            fractions of the domain length from the left of the
            domain of that axis: e.g., *x2 domain* refers to the
            domain of the second x  axis and a x position of 0.5
            refers to the point between the left and the right of
            the domain of the second x axis.
        xsizemode
            Sets the shapes's sizing mode along the x axis. If set
            to "scaled", `x0`, `x1` and x coordinates within `path`
            refer to data values on the x axis or a fraction of the
            plot area's width (`xref` set to "paper"). If set to
            "pixel", `xanchor` specifies the x position in terms of
            data or plot fraction but `x0`, `x1` and x coordinates
            within `path` are pixels relative to `xanchor`. This
            way, the shape can have a fixed width while maintaining
            a position relative to data or plot fraction.
        y0
            Sets the shape's starting y position. See `type` and
            `ysizemode` for more info.
        y1
            Sets the shape's end y position. See `type` and

        yanchor
            Only relevant in conjunction with `ysizemode` set to

            which `y0`, `y1` and y coordinates within `path` are
            relative to. E.g. useful to attach a pixel sized shape
            to a certain data value. No effect when `ysizemode` not
            set to "pixel".
        yref
            Sets the shape's y coordinate axis. If set to a y axis
            id (e.g. "y" or "y2"), the `y` position refers to a y
            coordinate. If set to "paper", the `y` position refers
            to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in
            normalized coordinates where 0 (1) corresponds to the
            bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by
            "domain" (separated by a space), the position behaves
            like for "paper", but refers to the distance in
            fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the
            domain of that axis: e.g., *y2 domain* refers to the
            domain of the second y  axis and a y position of 0.5
            refers to the point between the bottom and the top of
            the domain of the second y axis.
        ysizemode
            Sets the shapes's sizing mode along the y axis. If set
            to "scaled", `y0`, `y1` and y coordinates within `path`
            refer to data values on the y axis or a fraction of the
            plot area's height (`yref` set to "paper"). If set to
            "pixel", `yanchor` specifies the y position in terms of
            data or plot fraction but `y0`, `y1` and y coordinates
            within `path` are pixels relative to `yanchor`. This
            way, the shape can have a fixed height while
            maintaining a position relative to data or plot
            fraction.
