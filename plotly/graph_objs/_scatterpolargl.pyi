                colorscale
                    Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in
                    `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. The
                    colorscale must be an array containing arrays
                    mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba,
                    hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At
                    minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and
                    highest (1) values are required. For example,
                    `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`.
                    To control the bounds of the colorscale in
                    color space, use `marker.cmin` and
                    `marker.cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may
                    be a palette name string of the following list:
                    Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,
                    Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,Rd

                    effect only if in `marker.color` is set to a
                    numerical array. If true, `marker.cmin` will
                    correspond to the last color in the array and
                    `marker.cmax` will correspond to the first
                    color.
                showscale
                    Determines whether or not a colorbar is

        Parameters
        ----------
        arg
            dict of properties compatible with this constructor or

            :class:`plotly.graph_objs.Scatterpolargl`
        connectgaps
            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `customdata`.
        dr
            Sets the r coordinate step.
        dtheta
            Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the
            `dtheta` step equals the subplot's period divided by
            the length of the `r` coordinates.
        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
            "none" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
            "tonexty" ("tonextx") if `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use
            with `fillcolor` if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy"
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
            "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like "tozerox" and "tozeroy". "toself" connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            "toself" if there is no trace before it. "tonext"
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".

            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        legend
            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.
            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",
            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in
            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,
            etc.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes
            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same
            time when toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Legendgroup
            title` instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        line
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Line`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        marker
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Marker`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`
            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
            is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        r
            Sets the radial coordinates
        r0
            Alternate to `r`. Builds a linear space of r
            coordinates. Use with `dr` where `r0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dr` the step.
        rsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `r`.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Selected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Stream`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        subplot
            Sets a reference between this trace's data coordinates
            and a polar subplot. If "polar" (the default value),
            the data refer to `layout.polar`. If "polar2", the data
            refer to `layout.polar2`, and so on.
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variables `r`, `theta` and `text`.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        theta
            Sets the angular coordinates
        theta0
            Alternate to `theta`. Builds a linear space of theta
            coordinates. Use with `dtheta` where `theta0` is the
            starting coordinate and `dtheta` the step.
        thetasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `theta`.
        thetaunit
            Sets the unit of input "theta" values. Has an effect
            only when on "linear" angular axes.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterpolargl.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
