        then positioned with with `name` or with `x0` (`y0`) if
        provided.

        Parameters
        ----------
        arg
            dict of properties compatible with this constructor or
            an instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.Violin`
        alignmentgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
            whether bars compute their positional range dependently
            or independently.
        bandwidth
            Sets the bandwidth used to compute the kernel density
            estimate. By default, the bandwidth is determined by
            Silverman's rule of thumb.
        box
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Box` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `customdata`.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hoveron
            Do the hover effects highlight individual violins or
            sample points or the kernel density estimate or any
            combination of them?
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the

            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Same as `text`.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        jitter
            Sets the amount of jitter in the sample points drawn.
            If 0, the sample points align along the distribution
            axis. If 1, the sample points are drawn in a random
            jitter of width equal to the width of the violins.
        legend
            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.
            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",
            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in
            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,
            etc.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes
            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same
            time when toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Legendgrouptitle`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.

            dict with compatible properties
        meanline
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Meanline` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the
            legend item and on hover. For violin traces, the name
            will also be used for the position coordinate, if `x`
            and `x0` (`y` and `y0` if horizontal) are missing and
            the position axis is categorical. Note that the trace
            name is also used as a default value for attribute
            `scalegroup` (please see its description for details).
        offsetgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
            same position coordinate will line up.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation
            Sets the orientation of the violin(s). If "v" ("h"),
            the distribution is visualized along the vertical
            (horizontal).
        pointpos
            Sets the position of the sample points in relation to
            the violins. If 0, the sample points are places over
            the center of the violins. Positive (negative) values
            correspond to positions to the right (left) for
            vertical violins and above (below) for horizontal
            violins.
        points
            If "outliers", only the sample points lying outside the
            whiskers are shown If "suspectedoutliers", the outlier
            points are shown and points either less than 4*Q1-3*Q3
            or greater than 4*Q3-3*Q1 are highlighted (see
            `outliercolor`) If "all", all sample points are shown
            If False, only the violins are shown with no sample
            points. Defaults to "suspectedoutliers" when
            `marker.outliercolor` or `marker.line.outliercolor` is
            set, otherwise defaults to "outliers".
        quartilemethod
            Sets the method used to compute the sample's Q1 and Q3
            quartiles. The "linear" method uses the 25th percentile
            for Q1 and 75th percentile for Q3 as computed using
            method #10 (listed on
            http://jse.amstat.org/v14n3/langford.html). The
            "exclusive" method uses the median to divide the
            ordered dataset into two halves if the sample is odd,
            it does not include the median in either half - Q1 is
            then the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of
            the upper half. The "inclusive" method also uses the
            median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves
            but if the sample is odd, it includes the median in
            both halves - Q1 is then the median of the lower half
            and Q3 the median of the upper half.
        scalegroup
            If there are multiple violins that should be sized
            according to to some metric (see `scalemode`), link
            them by providing a non-empty group id here shared by
            every trace in the same group. If a violin's `width` is
            undefined, `scalegroup` will default to the trace's
            name. In this case, violins with the same names will be
            linked together
        scalemode
            Sets the metric by which the width of each violin is
            determined. "width" means each violin has the same
            (max) width "count" means the violins are scaled by the
            number of sample points making up each violin.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Selected` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        side
            Determines on which side of the position value the
            density function making up one half of a violin is
            plotted. Useful when comparing two violin traces under
            "overlay" mode, where one trace has `side` set to
            "positive" and the other to "negative".
        span
            Sets the span in data space for which the density
            function will be computed. Has an effect only when
            `spanmode` is set to "manual".
        spanmode
            Sets the method by which the span in data space where
            the density function will be computed. "soft" means the
            span goes from the sample's minimum value minus two
            bandwidths to the sample's maximum value plus two
            bandwidths. "hard" means the span goes from the
            sample's minimum to its maximum value. For custom span
            settings, use mode "manual" and fill in the `span`
            attribute.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Stream` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets the text elements associated with each sample
            value. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.violin.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        width
            Sets the width of the violin in data coordinates. If 0
            (default value) the width is automatically selected
            based on the positions of other violin traces in the
            same subplot.
        x
            Sets the x sample data or coordinates. See overview for
            more info.
        x0
            Sets the x coordinate for single-box traces or the
            starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using
            q1/median/q3. See overview for more info.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y sample data or coordinates. See overview for
            more info.
        y0
            Sets the y coordinate for single-box traces or the
            starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using
            q1/median/q3. See overview for more info.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-

            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.
