        Construct a new Box object

        Each box spans from quartile 1 (Q1) to quartile 3 (Q3). The
        second quartile (Q2, i.e. the median) is marked by a line
        inside the box. The fences grow outward from the boxes' edges,
        by default they span +/- 1.5 times the interquartile range
        (IQR: Q3-Q1), The sample mean and standard deviation as well as
        notches and the sample, outlier and suspected outliers points
        can be optionally added to the box plot. The values and
        positions corresponding to each boxes can be input using two
        signatures. The first signature expects users to supply the
        sample values in the `y` data array for vertical boxes (`x` for
        horizontal boxes). By supplying an `x` (`y`) array, one box per
        distinct `x` (`y`) value is drawn If no `x` (`y`) list is
        provided, a single box is drawn. In this case, the box is
        positioned with the trace `name` or with `x0` (`y0`) if
        provided. The second signature expects users to supply the
        boxes corresponding Q1, median and Q3 statistics in the `q1`,
        `median` and `q3` data arrays respectively. Other box features
        relying on statistics namely `lowerfence`, `upperfence`,
        `notchspan` can be set directly by the users. To have plotly
        compute them or to show sample points besides the boxes, users
        can set the `y` data array for vertical boxes (`x` for
        horizontal boxes) to a 2D array with the outer length
        corresponding to the number of boxes in the traces and the
        inner length corresponding the sample size.

        Parameters
        ----------
        arg

        alignmentgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
            whether bars compute their positional range dependently
            or independently.
        boxmean
            If True, the mean of the box(es)' underlying
            distribution is drawn as a dashed line inside the
            box(es). If "sd" the standard deviation is also drawn.
            Defaults to True when `mean` is set. Defaults to "sd"
            when `sd` is set Otherwise defaults to False.
        boxpoints
            If "outliers", only the sample points lying outside the
            whiskers are shown If "suspectedoutliers", the outlier
            points are shown and points either less than 4*Q1-3*Q3
            or greater than 4*Q3-3*Q1 are highlighted (see
            `outliercolor`) If "all", all sample points are shown
            If False, only the box(es) are shown with no sample
            points Defaults to "suspectedoutliers" when
            `marker.outliercolor` or `marker.line.outliercolor` is
            set. Defaults to "all" under the q1/median/q3
            signature. Otherwise defaults to "outliers".
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `customdata`.

            using q1/median/q3.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.

            or dict with compatible properties
        hoveron
            Do the hover effects highlight individual boxes  or
            sample points or both?
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-

            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc

        jitter
            Sets the amount of jitter in the sample points drawn.
            If 0, the sample points align along the distribution
            axis. If 1, the sample points are drawn in a random
            jitter of width equal to the width of the box(es).
        legend

            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.

            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the
            legend item and on hover. For box traces, the name will
            also be used for the position coordinate, if `x` and
            `x0` (`y` and `y0` if horizontal) are missing and the
            position axis is categorical
        notched
            Determines whether or not notches are drawn. Notches
            displays a confidence interval around the median. We
            compute the confidence interval as median +/- 1.57 *
            IQR / sqrt(N), where IQR is the interquartile range and
            N is the sample size. If two boxes' notches do not
            overlap there is 95% confidence their medians differ.
            See https://sites.google.com/site/davidsstatistics/home
            /notched-box-plots for more info. Defaults to False
            unless `notchwidth` or `notchspan` is set.
        notchspan
            Sets the notch span from the boxes' `median` values.
            There should be as many items as the number of boxes
            desired. This attribute has effect only under the
            q1/median/q3 signature. If `notchspan` is not provided
            but a sample (in `y` or `x`) is set, we compute it as
            1.57 * IQR / sqrt(N), where N is the sample size.
        notchspansrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `notchspan`.
        notchwidth
            Sets the width of the notches relative to the box'
            width. For example, with 0, the notches are as wide as
            the box(es).
        offsetgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
            same position coordinate will line up.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation
            Sets the orientation of the box(es). If "v" ("h"), the
            distribution is visualized along the vertical
            (horizontal).
        pointpos
            Sets the position of the sample points in relation to
            the box(es). If 0, the sample points are places over
            the center of the box(es). Positive (negative) values
            correspond to positions to the right (left) for
            vertical boxes and above (below) for horizontal boxes
        q1
            Sets the Quartile 1 values. There should be as many
            items as the number of boxes desired.
        q1src
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `q1`.
        q3
            Sets the Quartile 3 values. There should be as many
            items as the number of boxes desired.
        q3src
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `q3`.
        quartilemethod
            Sets the method used to compute the sample's Q1 and Q3
            quartiles. The "linear" method uses the 25th percentile
            for Q1 and 75th percentile for Q3 as computed using
            method #10 (listed on
            http://jse.amstat.org/v14n3/langford.html). The
            "exclusive" method uses the median to divide the
            ordered dataset into two halves if the sample is odd,
            it does not include the median in either half - Q1 is
            then the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of
            the upper half. The "inclusive" method also uses the
            median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves
            but if the sample is odd, it includes the median in
            both halves - Q1 is then the median of the lower half
            and Q3 the median of the upper half.
        sd
            Sets the standard deviation values. There should be as
            many items as the number of boxes desired. This
            attribute has effect only under the q1/median/q3
            signature. If `sd` is not provided but a sample (in `y`
            or `x`) is set, we compute the standard deviation for
            each box using the sample values.
        sdmultiple
            Scales the box size when sizemode=sd Allowing boxes to
            be drawn across any stddev range For example 1-stddev,
            3-stddev, 5-stddev
        sdsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `sd`.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Selected` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        showwhiskers
            Determines whether or not whiskers are visible.
            Defaults to true for `sizemode` "quartiles", false for
            "sd".
        sizemode
            Sets the upper and lower bound for the boxes quartiles
            means box is drawn between Q1 and Q3 SD means the box
            is drawn between Mean +- Standard Deviation Argument
            sdmultiple (default 1) to scale the box size So it
            could be drawn 1-stddev, 3-stddev etc
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Stream` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets the text elements associated with each sample
            value. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Unselected` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        upperfence
            Sets the upper fence values. There should be as many
            items as the number of boxes desired. This attribute
            has effect only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If
            `upperfence` is not provided but a sample (in `y` or
            `x`) is set, we compute the upper as the last sample
            point above 1.5 times the IQR.
        upperfencesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `upperfence`.
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        whiskerwidth
            Sets the width of the whiskers relative to the box'
            width. For example, with 1, the whiskers are as wide as
            the box(es).
        width
            Sets the width of the box in data coordinate If 0
            (default value) the width is automatically selected
            based on the positions of other box traces in the same
            subplot.
        x
            Sets the x sample data or coordinates. See overview for
            more info.
        x0
            Sets the x coordinate for single-box traces or the
            starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using
            q1/median/q3. See overview for more info.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y sample data or coordinates. See overview for
            more info.
        y0
            Sets the y coordinate for single-box traces or the
            starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using
            q1/median/q3. See overview for more info.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.
