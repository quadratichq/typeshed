                    only if in `marker.color` is set to a numerical

                cmax

                cmid
                    Sets the mid-point of the color domain by

                cmin
                    Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has

                color
                    Sets the marker color. It accepts either a
                    specific color or an array of numbers that are
                    mapped to the colorscale relative to the max

                coloraxis
                    Sets a reference to a shared color axis.
                    References to these shared color axes are

                colorscale
                    Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in
                    `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. The
                    colorscale must be an array containing arrays
                    mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba,
                    hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At
                    minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and
                    highest (1) values are required. For example,
                    `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`.
                    To control the bounds of the colorscale in
                    color space, use `marker.cmin` and
                    `marker.cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may
                    be a palette name string of the following list:
                    Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,

                    Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an
                    effect only if in `marker.color` is set to a
                    numerical array. If true, `marker.cmin` will
                    correspond to the last color in the array and
                    `marker.cmax` will correspond to the first
                    color.
                showscale
                    Determines whether or not a colorbar is
                    displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if
                    in `marker.color` is set to a numerical array.

                    Sets the marker size (in px).

            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`
            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
            `text` elements appear on hover.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattermapbox.Selected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattermapbox.Stream`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        subplot
            Sets a reference between this trace's data coordinates
            and a mapbox subplot. If "mapbox" (the default value),
            the data refer to `layout.mapbox`. If "mapbox2", the
            data refer to `layout.mapbox2`, and so on.
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair
            If a single string, the same string appears over all
            the data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (lon,lat)
            coordinates. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text"
            flag and "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be
            seen in the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the icon text font (color=mapbox.layer.paint.text-
            color, size=mapbox.layer.layout.text-size). Has an
            effect only when `type` is set to "symbol".
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variables `lat`, `lon` and `text`.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattermapbox.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
