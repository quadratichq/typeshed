        Sets this color bar's title font. Note that the title's font
        used to be set by the now deprecated `titlefont` attribute.

        The 'font' property is an instance of Font
        that may be specified as:
          - An instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.isosurface.colorbar.title.Font`
          - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
            to the Font constructor

            Supported dict properties:

                color

                family
                    HTML font family - the typeface that will be
                    applied by the web browser. The web browser
                    will only be able to apply a font if it is
                    available on the system which it operates.
                    Provide multiple font families, separated by
                    commas, to indicate the preference in which to
                    apply fonts if they aren't available on the
                    system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at
                    https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise)
                    generates images on a server, where only a
                    select number of fonts are installed and
                    supported. These include "Arial", "Balto",
                    "Courier New", "Droid Sans",, "Droid Serif",
                    "Droid Sans Mono", "Gravitas One", "Old
