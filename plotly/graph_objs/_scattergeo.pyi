                    Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in
                    `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. The
                    colorscale must be an array containing arrays
                    mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba,
                    hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At
                    minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and
                    highest (1) values are required. For example,
                    `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`.
                    To control the bounds of the colorscale in
                    color space, use `marker.cmin` and
                    `marker.cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may
                    be a palette name string of the following list:
                    Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,

        featureidkey
            Sets the key in GeoJSON features which is used as id to

        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with

            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        geo
            Sets a reference between this trace's geospatial
            coordinates and a geographic map. If "geo" (the default
            value), the geospatial coordinates refer to
            `layout.geo`. If "geo2", the geospatial coordinates
            refer to `layout.geo2`, and so on.
        geojson
            Sets optional GeoJSON data associated with this trace.
            If not given, the features on the base map are used

            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for

            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (lon,lat)
            pair or item in `locations`. If a single string, the
            same string appears over all the data points. If an
            array of string, the items are mapped in order to the
            this trace's (lon,lat) or `locations` coordinates. To
            be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        lat
            Sets the latitude coordinates (in degrees North).
        latsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `lat`.
        legend
            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.
            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",
            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in
            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,
            etc.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes
            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same
            time when toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergeo.Legendgrouptitl
            e` instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        line
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergeo.Line` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        locationmode
            Determines the set of locations used to match entries
            in `locations` to regions on the map. Values "ISO-3",
            "USA-states", *country names* correspond to features on
            the base map and value "geojson-id" corresponds to
            features from a custom GeoJSON linked to the `geojson`
            attribute.
        locations
            Sets the coordinates via location IDs or names.
            Coordinates correspond to the centroid of each location
            given. See `locationmode` for more info.
        locationssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `locations`.
        lon
            Sets the longitude coordinates (in degrees East).
        lonsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `lon`.
        marker
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergeo.Marker`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
            the provided `mode` includes "text" then the `text`
            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
            is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergeo.Selected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergeo.Stream`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair
            or item in `locations`. If a single string, the same
            string appears over all the data points. If an array of
            string, the items are mapped in order to the this
            trace's (lon,lat) or `locations` coordinates. If trace
            `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and "hovertext" is
            not set, these elements will be seen in the hover
            labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variables `lat`, `lon`, `location` and `text`.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergeo.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
