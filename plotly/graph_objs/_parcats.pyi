          - A list or tuple of dicts of string/value properties that

            Supported dict properties:

                categoryarray
                    Sets the order in which categories in this
                    dimension appear. Only has an effect if
                    `categoryorder` is set to "array". Used with
                    `categoryorder`.
                categoryarraysrc
                    Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                    for `categoryarray`.
                categoryorder
                    Specifies the ordering logic for the categories
                    in the dimension. By default, plotly uses
                    "trace", which specifies the order that is
                    present in the data supplied. Set
                    `categoryorder` to *category ascending* or
                    *category descending* if order should be
                    determined by the alphanumerical order of the
                    category names. Set `categoryorder` to "array"
                    to derive the ordering from the attribute
                    `categoryarray`. If a category is not found in
                    the `categoryarray` array, the sorting behavior
                    for that attribute will be identical to the
                    "trace" mode. The unspecified categories will
                    follow the categories in `categoryarray`.
                displayindex
                    The display index of dimension, from left to
                    right, zero indexed, defaults to dimension
                    index.
                label
                    The shown name of the dimension.

                    array the same length as `categoryarray` Used

                    dataset, therefore the `values` vector for all
                    dimensions must be the same (longer vectors
                    will be truncated).
                valuessrc
                    Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud

                colorscale
                    Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in
                    `line.color` is set to a numerical array. The
                    colorscale must be an array containing arrays
                    mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba,
                    hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At
                    minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and
                    highest (1) values are required. For example,
                    `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`.
                    To control the bounds of the colorscale in
                    color space, use `line.cmin` and `line.cmax`.

                    with different x positions from the first

                    Sets the shape of the paths. If `linear`, paths

            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the
            legend item and on hover.
        sortpaths
            Sets the path sorting algorithm. If `forward`, sort
            paths based on dimension categories from left to right.
            If `backward`, sort paths based on dimensions
            categories from right to left.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.parcats.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        tickfont
            Sets the font for the `category` labels.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
